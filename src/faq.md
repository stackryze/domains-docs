## Registration

### Can I change my subdomain name after registration?

No. Subdomain names cannot be changed. You must delete and register a new one.

### What if I make a mistake during registration?

Delete your domain within 15 days and register again. The name will be available after a 7-day cooling-off period.

[Registration guide →](getting-started)

### Why was my domain registration rejected?

Common reasons: name too short/long, invalid characters, already taken, or in cooling-off period.

## DNS & Nameservers

### What are nameservers?

Nameservers tell the internet where to find your domain. Default: `n1.stackryze.com` and `n2.stackryze.com`.

[DNS setup guides →](dns-providers)

### Can I use my own DNS provider?

Yes! Use Cloudflare, AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, or any other provider.

[Cloudflare setup (recommended) →](dns-providers/cloudflare)

### How long does DNS propagation take?

Typically 5-10 minutes, but can take up to 48 hours globally.

## Domain Management

### How do I renew my domain?

Go to [My Domains](https://domain.stackryze.com/my-domains), click "Renew", confirm. It's free!

[Renewal guide →](managing-domains#renewing-domains)

### What happens if my domain expires?

- **Days 1-15**: Grace period (domain still works)
- **Day 15**: Deleted, DNS removed
- **Days 15-22**: Cooling-off period
- **Day 22+**: Available again

[Expiry timeline →](managing-domains#what-if-i-dont-renew)

### How do I delete a domain?

Go to domain management page → "Danger Zone" → "Delete Domain". DNS is removed immediately.

[Deletion guide →](managing-domains#deleting-domains)

### Can I restore a deleted domain?

No. Once a domain is deleted, it enters a **7-day cooling-off period**. After this period, you (or anyone else) can register it again as a new domain.

## Account & Security

### Why do I need a GitHub account?

We use GitHub OAuth for secure authentication. It prevents spam and ensures accountability.

### Can I use a new GitHub account?

Your GitHub account must be at least **7 days old**. This prevents spam.

[Login troubleshooting →](troubleshooting#login-issues)

### How do I change my email address?

Your email is linked to GitHub. Update it in your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).

## Troubleshooting

### My domain isn't resolving

Check nameservers, DNS records, and wait up to 48 hours for propagation.

### I can't renew my domain

Renewal opens 60 days before expiry. Check your expiry date.

[Renewal issues →](troubleshooting#domain-management-issues)
